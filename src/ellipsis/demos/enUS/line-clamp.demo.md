# Line Clamp

Naive-ui provide multiple line ellipsis based on `-webkit-line-clamp`. See [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=line-clamp) for compatibility.

```html
<n-ellipsis :line-clamp="2">
  The lights are extinguished.<br />
  Matter is transformed and the heavens have shifted.<br />
  Clay figures vanish into the sea.<br />
  The darkness is like a boulder pressing down upon the breast.<br />
  The one-legged pirate and the millionaire fumble and grope on their
  bellies.<br />
  The darkness is like a boulder pressing down upon the breast.
</n-ellipsis>
