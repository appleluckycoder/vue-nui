## Documentation

## Features
### Caring About Styles
As is.
> The reason I started to build the library is I'm not satisfied with the UI framework I used. I think maybe it's possible to caring about nearily all the details of an UI framework, except the compitability of IE.
### Themed
Dark theme included. Theme switching is seamlessly.
> At first there's only dark mode UI design drafts. It's wired but true. After you starting to build a dark mode UI, sooner or later you will have to create a light theme for it. As a result, naive-ui has both of them.
### Batteries Included
There are more than 60 components. Utils for building themed component are provided.
### Not Rather Slow
I try to make it not rather slow.
> You can never know how much data will the backends send to you. Maybe thousands of options in single select.
