## Features
### Very Caring About Styles
As is.
> The reason I started to build the library is I'm not satisfied the UI framework my company used. Maybe it's possible to caring about nearily all the details of an UI framework, except compatibility of IE.
### Themed
Dark theme included. Theme can be changed seamlessly.
> When you find that the UI drafts are already in dark mode, you can't start with light theme. But if you start to build a dark mode UI, sooner or later you have to build a light themed UI. As a result, Naive UI has both of them.
### Batteries Included
More than 60 components. Utils for building themed components are provided.
